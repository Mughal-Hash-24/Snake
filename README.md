# Snake
A young me, fueled by creativity and love for gaming, decides to take on his third game development project i.e. "Snake" in python pygame. Call it efficient time management or my hate for pixel art at that time, but I decided to skip pixel art entirely for this game, which I shouldn't have when I look back at it.
