# Snake
A young me, fueled by creativity and love for gaming, decides to take on his third game development project i.e. "Snake" in python pygame. Call it efficient time management or my hate for pixel art at that time, but I decided to skip pixel art entirely for this game, which I shouldn't have when I look back at it.

# Insights
A 1976 classic, arcade game where the player controls a line and maneuvers it to to avoid the boundries. The catch is that when you eat a fruit the line you control grows. The game ends when the fills the entire available space on the screen. "Snake" was initially popular, but this popularity was sky rocketed when it was introduced in the mobile phone "Nokia 3310".

# Background
With initial succes in "Bean collector" and "Save the ball". I set out on a treacherous journey where I had to recreate the game "Snake". It was a struggle initially as I just couldn't wrap my head around the logic of turning the snake. ALso, the growing of the snake was a struggle as well. Despite all the the difficulties, I was able to push through and develop the game successfully.

# Features
- **Movement:** The game features smooth movements of the snake with minimal visual glitches.
- **RNG:** The game spawns in fruit at random positions when the previous one is eaten up.
- **Growing Mechanism:** As soon as the snake eats a fruit, its size grows.
- **Collision:** This game leverages the built in sprite collision of pygame, which is based on Axis Aligned Bounding Box Collision.
- **No Pixel Art:** This game relies on basic coloring and shapes with no pixel art or sprites as I was lazy back then.

# How to Run?
```bash
# Step 1: Make sure Python (3.7+) is installed
python --version

# Step 2: Install pygame if not already installed
pip install pygame

# Step 3: Run the game
python snake.py
```

# Lessons Learned 
- Simplicity is deceptive — even classic games like Snake require careful logic.
- Avoiding pixel art saved time, but it limited visual polish.
- Breaking problems into small chunks is key to overcoming logic blocks.

# Final Thoughts
This project was more than just a game — it was a test of persistence, logic, and creativity.
The result may be minimalist, but it carries the lessons of a full-fledged journey.

---

# Future improvements
- Snake sometimes spawns near wall edges, making initial gameplay tricky
- No pause/resume functionality yet
